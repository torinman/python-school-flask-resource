<h1>Hospital conditions from 1850 to 1900</h1>
<p>DId you know the first dunedin hospital only costed 250 british pounds to build, which is roughly $84000 NZD today, which is not alot for a hospital. Funding for the first Maori healthcare in hospitals began in 1852. Back then there were not as many surgeons and doctors so Health care was limited. That's why some people often relied on natural remedies.
