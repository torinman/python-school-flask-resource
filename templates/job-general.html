<h1>Domestic service in 19th century New Zealand</h1>
<p>Most homes usually only had one servant: the general servant. This servant did most things in the house, including, but not limited to cleaning, washing, looking after children, chickens and vegetables, shopping, sewing, and making soap.

Often, keeping servants was a status symbol, and looked upon highly.
