<h1>Natural remedies from 1850 to 1900</h1>
<p>Leaves, roots and plants  are all things that are not really associated with medicine, but for some people in the 1850s thatâ€™s all they had. Some stuff they used includes Kawakawa Leaves, Harakeke roots, Koromiko leaves beaten and crushed and the bark of a Rata tree bark all for different purposes. Rata Tree bark was soaked in water then applied as a lotion Kawakawa leaves were used to treat cuts,wounds and stomach aches.</p>
